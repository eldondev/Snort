books, records and facilities to permit Sourcefire to verify appropriate
use of the VRT Certified Rules and compliance with this Agreement.
Sourcefire's non-exercise of this right, or its failure to discover or
object to any inappropriate use or other breach of this Agreement by
you, shall not constitute its consent thereto or waiver of Sourcefire's
rights hereunder or under law.  In the event your use of the VRT
Certified Rules is not in compliance with a Permitted Use, or if you
otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement, Sourcefire may, since
remedies at law may be inadequate, in addition to its other remedies:

further use of the VRT Certified Rules; (c) assess you the cost of
Sourcefire's inspection and enforcement efforts (including attorney
fees); and/or (d) assess you a use fee appropriate to your actual use of

Modifications are being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government

and only as set forth in this Agreement; and only with "Limited Rights"
and "Restricted Rights" as defined the federal regulations if the
commercial terms are deemed not to apply..
