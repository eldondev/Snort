--
Summary:
This event is generated when spurious DNS traffic is detected on the network. 

--
Impact:
Ranges from harmless to severe.  A successful corrupted DNS IP and name pairing can range from harmless (if the IP is not used) to severe (if a user is misdirected to a hostile host).

--
Detailed Information:

This may be the result of an improperly configured DNS server or it may be an indication that an attack against the DNS server is underway.

--
Affected Systems:

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can spoof a DNS response to misrepresent an IP to host/name pairing.  The forged host name can direct a user to a potentially hostile host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple to Difficult depending on the DNS implementation.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
