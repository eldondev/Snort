-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in Ethereal.

-- 
Impact: 
Serious. Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
Ethereal is a multi-platform network protocol analyser capable of
displaying network data to the user in a graphical user interface.

An error in the processing of access control lists (ACLs) concerning the
size of the access control entries (ACEs) may lead to a Denial of Service
(DoS) condition in Ethereal. The ACL parsing routine trusts the size of
the ACE given in the packet during processing. If a sufficiently large ACL
structure is supplied combined with a specified ACE size of 0, it is
possible to cause the DoS condition to occur.

--
Affected Systems:
	Ethereal 0.10.7 and prior

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker needs to craft packet data containing large NT ACLs, the
attacker then needs to specify one of the ACEs as having a size of 0.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Moderate.

-- 
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

-- 
Corrective Action: 
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patch

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
