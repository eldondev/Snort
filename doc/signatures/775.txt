Corrective Action:

This is a particularly difficult Trojan to remove and should only be attempted by an experienced Windows Administrator.

Edit the system registry to remove the extra keys or restore a previously known good copy of the registry.

Affected registry keys are:

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\Run

Registry keys added are:

	StartIE=C:\WINDOWS\notepad.exe qazwsx.hsq

This will start the Trojan each time notepad is executed.

Look for the existence of the file note.com. The file notepad.exe may have been replaced with a Trojaned version that is approximately 120 kb in size (the original is 52 kb).

A machine reboot is required to clear the existing process from running in memory.
