Rule: 

--
Sid: 608

--
Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt to modify access control permissions for remote shell logins is attempted.

--
Impact: 
An attacker may have modified remote login permissions such that any host is allowed to initiate a remote session on the target host.

-- 
Detailed Information: 
The rule generates an event when system reconfiguration is attempted via "rsh". 

The command "echo + +" is used to relax access control permissions for r-services to allow access from any site without the need for password authentication. 

This activity is indicative of attempts to abuse hosts using a default configuration. 

Some UNIX systems use the "rsh" service to allow a connection to the machine for establishing an interactive session.

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker finds a machine with "rsh" enabled and reconfigures it to allow access from any location

--
Ease of Attack: 
Simple, no exploit software required

--
False Positives: 
None Known

--
False Negatives: 
None Known

--
Corrective Action: 
Investigate logs on the target host for further details and more signs of suspicious activity

Use ssh for remote access instead of rlogin.
