Sid:
1911

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow associated with the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) sadmind.


--
Impact:
Remote root access.  This attack may permit execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of root.

--
Detailed Information:
The sadmind RPC service is used by Solaris Solstice AdminSuite applications to perform remote distributed system administration tasks such as adding new users.  A buffer overflow associated with the NETMGT_PROC_SERVICE request of sadmind exists because of improper bounds checking.  This may permit execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of root.

--
Affected Systems:
Sun Solaris 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 7.0

--
Attack Scenarios:
Exploit code can be used to attack a vulnerable sadmind to obtain root access to the remote host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  Exploit scripts are freely available. 

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Limit remote access to RPC services.

Filter RPC ports at the firewall to ensure access is denied to RPC-enabled machines. 

Disable unneeded RPC services.
