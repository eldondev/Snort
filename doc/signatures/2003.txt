Summary:

This event is generated when an attempt is made by the "Slammer" worm to compromise a Microsoft SQL Server.

--
Impact:
A worm targeting a vulnerability in the MS SQL Server 2000 Resolution 
Service was released on January 25th, 2003.  The worm attempts to 
exploit a buffer overflow in the Resolution Service.  Because of the 
nature of the vulnerability, the worm is able to attempt to compromise 
other machines very rapidly.

--
Detailed Information:
The Monitor Service provided by MS SQL and MSDE uses unchecked client
provided data in an SQL version check function.

The worm attempts to exploit a buffer overflow in this version request.
If the worm sends too many bytes in the request that triggers the 
version check, then a buffer overflow condition is triggered resulting 
in a potential compromise of the SQL Server.

--
Affected Systems:
This vulnerability is present in unpatched MS SQL Servers.  The following unpatched services containing MS SQL or Microsoft Desktop Engine (MSDE) may potentially be compromised by this worm:

* SQL Server 2000 (Developer, Standard, and Enterprise Editions)
* Visual Studio .NET (Architect, Developer, and Professional Editions)
* ASP.NET Web Matrix Tool
* Office XP Developer Edition
* MSDN Universal and Enterprise subscriptions

--
Attack Scenarios:
This is worm activity.

A worm has been written that automatically exploits this vulnerability.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
