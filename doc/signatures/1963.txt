Summary:
The RQUOTA daemon is an RPC server that returns quotas for users on the 
local file systems.  

Some versions of solaris ship with a vulnerable version of snoop that 
attempts to parse RQUOTA GETQUOTA requests.  Snoop contains a boundary 
condition error that could result in a buffer overflow that will present
the attacker with super user access to the target host.

--
Impact:
Complete control of the target machine.

--
Detailed Information:
The sniffing program named snoop is installed on certain version of Sun 
Solaris.

When run by the super-user, snoop will monitor network traffic on the 
host's network segment.  When snoop attempts to decode RQUOTA GETQUOTA 
requests, snoop does not properly handle user supplied data resulting in
a buffer overflow.

--
Affected Systems:
Sun Solaris 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7 for SPARC and Intel architectures

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker must send specially crafted packets past a network segment 
monitored by vulnerable versions of snoop

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate patches for each affected system.

Use a different network monitoring tool other than snoop.

Disallow all RPC requests from external sources and use a firewall to 
block access to RPC ports from outside the LAN.
