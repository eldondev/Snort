Rule:  

--
Sid:
2318

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in the Concurrent Versions System (CVS).

--
Impact:
Serious. Manipulation of the host file system is possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is used to track the history of source
code files when developing software.

Some versions of CVS contain a vulnerability that may allow an attacker
to create directories or files in the host filesystem external to the
cvsroot. This is achieved via a malformed module request.

--
Affected Systems:
	CVS versions prior to 1.11.10

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may send a specially crafted request to a cvs server and
create files and directories of their choosing in the hosts root
filesystem. The attacker may then access these files at will to further
compromise the system.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. No exploit software is required.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
If compression is being used in data communications between the CVS
server and clients, this rule will not generate an event.

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
