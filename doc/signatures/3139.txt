Sid: 
3139

-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in Microsoft systems using Server Message Block (SMB).

-- 
Impact: 
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code leading to unauthorized
administrative access to the target host. Denial of Service (DoS) is
also possible.

--
Detailed Information:
SMB is a client - server protocol used in sharing resources such as
files, printers, ports, named pipes and other things, between machines
on a network.

A vulnerability in the Microsoft implementation of SMB exists due to a
programming error which may present an attacker with the opportunity to
exploit the service and run code of their choosing on an affected
system. The attacker may then cause a DoS condition in the service or
possibly gain unauthorized access to the target host.

A malicious attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a
malicious response from a server in response to a client request using
SMB.

--
Affected Systems:
	Microsoft Windows 2003
	Microsoft Windows 2000
	Microsoft Windows XP

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker can supply extra data in the message from the server
containing code of their choosing to be run on the client.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Simple.

-- 
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

-- 
Corrective Action: 
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.

Turn off windows file and print services.

Use Samba as an alternative.
