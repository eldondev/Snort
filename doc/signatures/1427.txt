--
Sid:
1427

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to attack a device using SNMP v1.

--
Impact:
Varies depending on the implementation. Ranges from Denial of Service (DoS) to code execution.

--
Detailed Information:
SNMP is a widely adopted protocol for managing IP networks, including individual network devices, and devices in aggregate. 

Several network devices come pre-installed with this protocol for management and monitoring.

A number of vulnerabilities exist in SNMP v1, including a community string 
buffer overflow, that will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or shutdown the service.

--
Affected Systems:
Any implementation of SNMP v1 protocol
	
--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker needs to send a specially crafted packet to UDP port 161 
of a vulnerable device, causing a Denial of Service or possible execution of 
arbitrary code.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Disable the SNMP v1 protocol, use SNMP v2 protocol as an alternative.

Disable the use of SNMP for devices that do not need it.

Use Ingress/Egress filtering on a packet filtering firewall.
