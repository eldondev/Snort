Summary:
This event is generated when an SNMP-Trap connection over UDP to an SNMP
daemon is made.

--

Impact:
Information gathering

--

Detailed Information:
The SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) Trap daemon usually 
listens on port 161, tcp or udp.

An attacker may attempt to send this request to determine if a device is
using SNMP.

--

Affected Systems:
Devices running SNMP daemons on well known ports.

--

Attack Scenarios:
An attacker sends a packet directed to udp port 161, if sucessful a 
reply is generated and the attacker may then launch further attacks 
against the SNMP daemon.

--

Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--

False Positives:
None known.

--

False Negatives:
None known.

--

Corrective Action:
Use a packet filtering firewall to protect devices using the SNMP 
protocol and only allow connections from well-known hosts.
