Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow
associated with the Mail Transfer Agent Exim.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may allow the execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable
server with the privilege of the process running Exim.

--
Detailed Information:
Exim is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, permitting an attacker to execute
arbitrary code.  The vulnerability may be exploited if Exim is configured to
verify header syntax in the e-mail message body.  This is not the default
configuration.  If an attacker supplies a large number of spaces after certain
header fields, it may be possible to cause a buffer overflow.

--
Affected Systems:
Exim prior to version 4.34

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can create and send mail with a malformed header,
possibly causing a buffer overflow and permitting the execution of arbitrary code.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.
--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
