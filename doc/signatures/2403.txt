Sid:
2403

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in ISS RealSecure and BlackICE products.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code, DoS.

--
Detailed Information:
A buffer overflow condition in the ISS Analysis Module can be triggered
by an attacker sending a single SMB packet containing an AccountName
greater than 300 bytes. It is possible for an attacker to exploit this
condition by sending a specially crafted packet to a host serving network shares.

When the systems running one of the affected ISS products decodes the
SMB data, exploit code may be included and executed on the machine with 
system level privileges. Alternatively, the malformed data may cause the service to become 
unresponsive and cause a DoS condition.

Sensors under attack will display "PAM_internal_error" as a message on
the console.

Sucessful exploitation of this issue could present an attacker with the 
opportunity to execute code of their choosing on the target host with system
privileges. It is also possible for a Denial of Service (DoS) condition to 
be caused by an attacker attempting to exploit this condition.

network or potentially use it to gain control of a machine running one
of the affected products.
