--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer
overflow associated with the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) ToolTalk.

--
Impact:
Remote root access. This attack may permit the execution of arbitrary
commands with the privileges of root.

--
Detailed Information:
The ttdbserverd RPC service, more commonly known as the ToolTalk
database server, allows applications to communicate in the Common
Desktop Environment (CDE).  The ToolTalk service receives ToolTalk
messages created and sent by applications and delivers them to the
appropriate recipient applications.  The ToolTalk database server is
enabled by default on hosts with CDE.  A function in the code receives
an argument for a pathname.  If an overly long pathname is passed to the
function, a buffer overflow may occur, possibly allowing the execution
of arbitrary commands with the privileges of root.

Affected Systems:
	HP HP-UX 10.10, 10.20, 10.30, 11.0
	IBM AIX 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4, 4.1.5, 4.2, 4.2.1, 4.3
	SGI IRIX 5.2, 5.3, 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
	Sun Solaris 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.4, 1.2, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3,
	2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can query the portmapper to discover the port where
ttdbserverd runs.  Alternately, an attacker may attempt to execute the
exploit code on any listening port in the RPC range if the portmapper is
blocked.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  Exploit scripts are freely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Limit remote access to RPC services.

Filter RPC ports at the firewall to ensure access is denied to
RPC-enabled machines.

Disable unneeded RPC services.
