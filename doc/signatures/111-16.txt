-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when the pre-processor stream4
detects network traffic that may constitute an attack.

-- 
Impact: 
Unknown. This may be an IDS evasion attempt.

--
Detailed Information:
The pre-processor stream4 has detected a TCP session that contains
retransimitted data without the necessary retransmission request. This
may be an attempt to evade any monitoring IDS.

--
Affected Systems:
	All systems

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker could supply two packets containing different data, one with
a malicious payload destined for a vulnerable host and the other with a
benign payload meant for the IDS. The second packet may disguise itself
in the session as retransmitted data.

-- 
Ease of Attack: 
Difficult.

-- 
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

-- 

Corrective Action:
Check the target host for signs of compromise.

Ensure the system is up to date with any appropriate vendor supplied patches.
