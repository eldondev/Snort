Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow
associated with the processing of a Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file by
the GD Graphics Library.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may cause a denial of service or a buffer overflow and the
subsequent execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable server.

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that software that handles PNG files,
libpng, allocates memory for PNG images. A maliciously formatted PNG
image sent to a vulnerable server may cause a buffer overflow and the
subsequent execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable server.  A
PNG file with an excessively large image height, width, or depth, or
combination of these can cause a buffer overflow.

--
Affected Systems:
	GD Graphics Library 2.0.28 and earlier

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can create a malformed PNG file and upload it to a web server,
possibly causing a buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.

Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches.
