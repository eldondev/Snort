--
Sid:
1455

--
Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to access a web 
application that may lead to exploitation of the application.

--
Impact: 
Potentially harmful execution of binaries through perl open()

--
Detailed Information: 
An open source calendar perl script by Matt Kruse, Allows commands to be executed without input verification using the perl open() function. ie /cgi-bin/calendar.pl place the string "|ping 127.0.0.1|" in the configuration file field, this executes the command "ping 127.0.0.1" 

--
Affected Systems:
Any web server running the application.

--
Attack Scenarios: 
An unauthenticated user can execute arbitrary programs on the server by accessing calendar.pl and inputting commands such as "|mail /etc/passwd|" into the configuration file field.

--
Ease of Attack: 
Simple. No exploit software required.

--
False Positives: 
If your webserver has pages by the name of calendar.pl this rule will
fire often. Many sites now use calendar applications and this rule may 
generate a large number of false positives, it does not distinguish 
between perl cgi applications and php scripts. Consider tuning this rule
for your site if it is generating a large number of false positives. If 
you use a calendar application, consider changing the name of the script
to something other than "calendar.pl".

--
False Negatives: 
None known.

--
Corrective Action: 
Download a newer version of the cgi
