Sid:
2308

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows Workstation service.

--
Impact:
Serious. Denial of Service (DoS), execution of arbitrary code is
possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Due to insufficient bounds checking in the Microsoft Windows Workstation
service, it may be possible for an attacker to overwrite portions of
memory. This can result in the attacker being presented with the
opportunity to execute code of their choosing. Under some circumstances
a Denial of Service condition may be possible against the target host.

Specifically, the DCE/RPC service allows for overly long strings to be
sent to the Workstation logging function. This logging function does not
check parameters sufficiently which results in the buffer overflow
condition.

--
Affected Systems:
	Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, Service Pack 3, Service Pack 4
	Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1
	Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker may use one of the available exploits to target a
vulnerable host.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code exists.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches and service packs.
