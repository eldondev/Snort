2444

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in multiple versions of Internet Security Systems software.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code is possible leading to unauthorized 
access to the affected host. Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
A vulnerability exists in the way that multiple ISS products parse ICQ
messages. This can lead to execution of arbitrary code on hosts using
the affected products.

Due to insufficient bounds checking when ISS products parse protocol
fields in ICQ SRV_META_USER data, a buffer overflow condition can be
exploited to give an attacker the opportunity to execute arbitrary code
and gain unauthorized administrative access to the host.

It is possible that this condition can be exploited without the need for
an established and valid ICQ session. The attacker could create packets
originating from a host on port 4000 and send specially crafted data to 
exploit the condition.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may send specially crafted packets to a vulnerable system to
cause the overflow condition to occur.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.
