Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in Ebola from PLD Software.

--
Impact:
Serious. Execution of arbitrary code may be possible.

--
Detailed Information:
Ebola from PLD Software is used to improve the performance of Anti-Virus
solutions on Linux systems.

A buffer overflow condition is present in the authentication mechanism
such that it may be triggered by the generation of an error message from
an unsuccessful authentication attempt.

--
Affected Systems:
	All versions of Ebola prior to 0.1.5

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can send specially crafted authentication attempts to the Ebola system and
cause the buffer overflow thus presenting the opportunity to execute
arbitrary code.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Expoits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
