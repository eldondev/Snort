-- 
Summary: 
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
buffer overflow associated with MDaemon IMAP authentication
processing.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can permit a buffer overflow and the
subsequent execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable
server.

--
Detailed Information:
The MDaemon IMAP server allows basic authentication to be
exchanged between the client and server.  A vulnerability
exists allowing an unauthenticated user to cause a buffer
overflow by crafting an overly long authentication reply
to a server challenge.  This can allow execution of arbitrary
code on a vulnerable server.

--
Affected Systems:
Alt-N MDaemon prior to 8.0.4

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can request IMAP authentication and reply to
a server challenge with an overly long response, causing
a buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
