Rule:

--
Sid:
1926

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a request is made to Network File System (NFS) to list all exported file systems and to indicate which clients are permitted to mount each file system.

--
Impact:
Information disclosure.  This can allow an attacker to discover exported NFS file systems and client mount permissions.

--
Detailed Information:
The mountd Remote Procedure Call (RPC) implements the NFS mount protocol.  When an NFS client requests a mount of an NFS file system, mountd examines the list of exported file systems.  If the NFS client is permitted access to the requested file system, mountd returns a file handle for the requested directory.  An attacker or legitimate NFS client may request a list of exported file systems and client mount permissions.

--
Affected Systems:
All systems running NFS.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may attempt to list the exported NFS file systems as a precursor to mounting them to read or change a specific file. 

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.   

--
False Positives:
If a legitimate remote user is allowed to list exported NFS file systems, this rule may trigger.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Limit remote access to RPC services.

Filter RPC ports at the firewall to ensure access is denied to RPC-enabled machines. 

Disable unneeded RPC services.
