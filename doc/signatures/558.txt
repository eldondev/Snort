--

Detailed Information:

GNUTella is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) protocol for exchanging arbitrary
files.  Depending on your site's policies, using it may be a policy
violation.

If not properly configured, GNUTella clients may accidentally share out
confidential files.  GNUTella worms (which use deceptive names to
encourage download) and viruses may also be accidentally downloaded by a
client.

This rule being triggered means that a GNUTella client has been detected
on the protected network.

platforms)

and its messages will trigger this alert.
