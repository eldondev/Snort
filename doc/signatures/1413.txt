--

Summary:
This event is generated when an SNMP connection over UDP using the 
default 'private' community is made.

--

Impact:
Information gathering

--

Detailed Information:
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) v1 uses communities and IP 
addresses to authenticate communication between the SNMP client and SNMP
daemon. Many SNMP implementations come pre-configured with 'public' and 
'private' communities. If these are not disabled, the attacker can 
gather a great deal of information about the device running the SNMP 
daemon.

--

Affected Systems:
Devices running SNMP daemons with 'public' community enabled.

--

Attack Scenarios:
An attacker scans a range of IPs for SNMP servers having the 'public' 
community set and gathers information about the hosts.

--

Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--

False Positives:
None known.

--

False Negatives:
None known.

--

Corrective Action:
Disable the 'public' and 'private' communities before connecting the 
device with SNMP on the Internet or block access to SNMP ports using a 
packet filtering firewall for unauthorized addresses.
