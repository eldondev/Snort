--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a buffer overflow associated with the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Calendar Manager Service daemon, cmsd.

--
Impact:
Remote root access.  The attack may allow execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of root.

--
Detailed Information:
The cmsd RPC service implements the Calendar Manager Service daemon that is often distributed with the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) and Open Windows.  The Calendar Manager daemon provides appointment and scheduling functions for CDE.  A buffer overflow exists in the rtable_insert() function because of improper bounds checking, allowing the execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of root.  One possible exploit vector is by inserting appointments into the Calendar Manager database.

Affected Systems:
SCO Open UNIX 8.0
SCO UnixWare 7.1.1
HP-UX 10.20, 10.24, 10.30, 11.0
Sun Solaris 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 7.0
Sun SunOS 4.1.3, 4.1.4

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can use the exploit code to overflow the buffer allowing execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of root.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  Exploit code is freely available.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Limit remote access to RPC services.

Filter RPC ports at the firewall to ensure access is denied to RPC-enabled machines. 

Disable unneeded RPC services.
