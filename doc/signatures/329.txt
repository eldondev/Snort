Sid: 329

-- 
Summary: 
This is an intelligence gathering activity. This event is indicative of a connection laundering attack against the finger daemon

-- 
Impact: 
The attacker may obtain information about a third party host without making a direct connection to that host.

--
Detailed Information:
The event is generated when an attempt to use a machine to run
finger queries against a third party UNIX system is attempted by the
Cybercop vulnerability scanner. 

The attack utilizes "finger forwarding" functionality, normally used to forward queries to a third party machine. The information is obtained without a direct connection to the said third party, since the target system performs a connection to the third party host for the attacker. 

The Finger daemon is used to provide information about users on a UNIX system. It used to be installed and enabled by default on most UNIX/Linux systems. The attack if successful, will confirm that the target host will try to forward queries.

--

Attack Scenarios: 
An attacker uses the Cybercop vulnerability scanner to test for this weakness.

-- 

Ease of Attack: 
Simple, performed by a scanner

-- 

False Positives: 
None Known

--
False Negatives: 
None Known

-- 

Corrective Action: 
Disable the finger daemon or upgrade to a daemon without finger forwarding functionality
