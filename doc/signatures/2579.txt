Rule:

--
Sid:
2579

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a heap overflow
associated with Kerberos V5.

--
Impact:
A successful attack may cause a heap overflow, permitting the execution of
arbitrary code.

--
Detailed Information:
When Kerberos V5 uses a non-default configuration of enabling rules-based
mapping, it is possible to cause a heap overflow and the subsequent
execution of arbitrary code on the vulnerable host.  The attacker has
to successfully authenticate in order to exploit the vulnerability.
If an attacker supplies an overly long principal name, it may be possible
to cause a heap overflow on the vulnerable Kerberos-enabled server.

--
Affected Systems:
MIT Kerberos V5 including krb5-1.3.3

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker authenticates to the Kerberos server and later supplies
an overly long principle name when attempting to connect to a server
that employs Kerberos authentication. This can cause a heap overflow
and subsequent execution of code on a vulnerable server.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the latest non-affected version of the software.
