Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in the handling of ISAKMP data and SA keys.

--
Impact:
Serious

--
Detailed Information:
The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) 
is used as a framework for an authentication method between peers using 
secure keys.

ISAKMP is a framework for authentication using cryptographic keys. It 
specifically defines the process of key exchange as opposed to the 
generation of a cryptographic key.

ISAKMP also details the procedures for the required security 
associations in network security services.

--
Affected Systems:
	Kame Racoon

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker may attempt to delete keys and security associations in
hosts running the KAME IKE Daemon.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patches
