Rule:

--
Sid:
1954

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a request is made to discover the Process ID (PID) of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) amd.

--
Impact:
Information disclosure.  This request can allow an attacker to discover the PID associated with amd.

--
Detailed Information:
The amd RPC service implements the automounter daemon on UNIX hosts.  The amd  service automatically mounts and unmounts requested file systems.  An attacker can make a request to amd to discover its PID.  Learning the PID may help an attacker guess a range of likely PIDs associated with other running services that are either started before or after amd.  This may facilitate an attack against other running processes.  

--
Affected Systems:
Any system running amd.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may request the PID associated with amd.  This information may be used to attack other running processes if the attacker has some means of access to the target host. 

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  Execute the command 'amq -p -U -h hostname/IP'.

--
False Positives:
None Known.

--
False Negatives:
None Known.

--
Corrective Action:
Limit remote access to RPC services.

Filter RPC ports at the firewall to ensure access is denied to RPC-enabled machines. 

Disable unneeded RPC services.
