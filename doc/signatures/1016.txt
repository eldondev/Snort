--
Sid:
1016

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to craft a URL containing a reference to the "/global.asa" file.

--
Impact:
Intelligence gathering.  This attack may permit disclosure of the source code of global.asa file that is not normally available for viewing.

--
Detailed Information:
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 contains scripting engines to support various advanced files types such as .ASP and .HTR.  The scripting engines permit the execution of server-side processing.  IIS determines which scripting engine is appropriate depending on the file extension.  If an attacker crafts a URL request ending in 'Translate: f' and followed by a slash '/', IIS fails to send the file to the appropriate scripting engine for processing.  Instead, it returns the source code of a referenced file, such as global.asa, to the browser.  The Nessus vulnerability scanner references the global.asa file in a GET request to determine whether a host is susceptible to this exploit.

--
Affected Systems:
Microsoft IIS 5.0

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can craft a URL that includes the 'Translate: f' followed by a '/' to disclose the source code of a file such as global.asa on the vulnerable server. 

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  The Nessus vulnerability scanner can test for this exploit. 

--
False Positives:
None Known.

False Negatives:
None Known.
