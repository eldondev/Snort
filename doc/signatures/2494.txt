--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a known
vulnerability in the Microsoft RPC service.

--
Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS). Possible execution of arbitrary code leading to
unauthorized remote access to the victim host.

--
Detailed Information:
It may be possible for an attacker to cause a DoS condition in the
Microsoft RPC service when multiple simultaneous requests are made to a
vulnerable host. This can lead to an exhaustion of system resources
causing the DoS.

--
Affected Systems:
	Windows systems running RPC services

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker may attempt to bind to the RPC service many times in an
attempt to cause the DoS condition to occur.

--
Ease of Attack:
Difficult.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Block access to RPC ports 135, 139 and 445 for both TCP and UDP 
protocols from external sources using a packet filtering firewall.
