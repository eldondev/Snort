Summary:
KCMS (Kodak Color Management System) is an RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
service for Sun Solaris operating systems. It is able to read profiles
stored on remote machines. It is possible for an attacker to bypass
directory traversal checks and read any file on the remote system.

--
Impact:
Possible theft of data and control of the targeted machine leading to a
compromise of all resources on the machine not limited to user accounts
and business data.

--
Detailed Information:
The attacker first needs to create a directory under
/etc/openwin/devdata/profiles or /usr/openwin/etc/devdata/profiles,
using the ToolTalk database server is one method of creating a
directory. Once this has been achieved, the attacker is then able to
perform the directory traversal.

The directory traversal allows the attacker to read any file on the
compromised system. Once a sensitive system file such as the system
password database has been retrieved, the attacker may use other tools
at his leisure to discover username and password information. This may
lead to further system compromise.

The KCMS daemon runs with root privileges and is typically started on
boot via inetd. The ToolTalk database server is also commonly installed
and started in this manner. The KCMS daemon usually listens on TCP port
32871 although this can vary.

--
Affected Systems:
	Sun Microsystems Solaris 2.5.1 (Sparc/Intel)
	Sun Microsystems Solaris 2.6 (Sparc/Intel)
	Sun Microsystems Solaris 7 (Sparc/Intel)
	Sun Microsystems Solaris 8 (Sparc/Intel)
	Sun Microsystems Solaris 9 (Sparc/Intel)

--
Attack Scenarios:
The ToolTalk database server procedure TT_ISBUILD can be used to create
a directory named TT_DB anywhere on a remote system. Creation of this
directory then allows the attacker to use directory traversal to further
compromise the machine.

--
Ease of Attack:
Once the directory has been created, further compromise is simple.

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Disable the KCMS daemon in the file /etc/inetd.conf. Kill any running
KCMS processes and restart the inet daemon.

Configure your firewall to restrict external access to the TCP and UDP
port 111 used by the RPC port mapper service and the range used by RPC
services, typically 32700 to 34000.
