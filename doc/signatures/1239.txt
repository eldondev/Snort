Rule:

--
Sid:
1239

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to execute the RFParalyze DoS
exploit.

--
Impact:
If the destination machine is vulnerable, it may start behaving
unpredictably.  Succesful exploitation may lead to a full system crash 
or may cause certain services to become unavailable.

--
Detailed Information:
This signature triggers on execution of RFParalyze, an exploit written 
in 2000 by Rain Forest Puppy.  It was based on a binary exploit called 
"whisper", which was used in the wild at that time.  This exploit 
performs a NetBIOS session request with a source host of NULL, which is 
incorrectly handled by Windows 95/98 hosts.

--
Affected Systems:
	Windows 95
	Windows 98

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can crash critical machines, thereby
preventing them from being accessed by legitimate clients.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.  Exploit code exists.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
Potential future versions of this exploit, which may use
different message strings, will not be detected by this rule.

--
Corrective Action: 
Patches are not available from the vendor.

Use a packet filtering firewall to block inbound traffic to port 139/TCP from
all untrusted networks & hosts

Upgrade critical machines to a more recent and supported version of the
operating system.
