Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a cross site 
scripting vulnerability in the "MyPHP Guestbook" application running on a 
webserver.

Impact:
Information gathering and system integrity compromise. Possible unauthorized 
administrative access to the server or application. Possible execution of 
arbitrary code of the attackers choosing in some cases.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to exploit a cross site 
scripting vulnerability via the "name" parameter in the "edit.php" script used 
by the "MyPHP Guestbook" application running on a webserver.

If stringent input checks are not performed by the CGI application, it may also 
be possible for an attacker to retrieve sensitive data, execute system binaries 
or malicious code of the attackers choosing.

--
Affected Systems:
All systems running CGI applications using MyPHP Guestbook
--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can supply a malicious link designed to steal information from a 
user clicking on that link.

--
Ease of Attack:

--
False Positives:

--
False Negatives:

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has had
