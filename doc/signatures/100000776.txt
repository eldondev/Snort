--
Sid:
100000776
--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability in the "Blog CMS" application running on a webserver. Access to the file "index.php" with SQL commands being passed as the "query" parameter may indicate that an exploitation attempt has been attempted. 

--
Impact:
Information gathering and system integrity compromise. Possible unauthorized administrative access to the server or application. Possible execution of arbitrary code of the attackers choosing in some cases.

--
Detailed Information:
This event indicates that an attempt has been made to inject SQL code from a remote machine via the "query" parameter in the "index.php" script used by the "Blog CMS" application running on a webserver.

If stringent input checks are not performed by the CGI application, it may also be possible for an attacker to compromise the database backend for the application, the attacker may also be able to execute system binaries or malicious code of their choosing.

This event is generated when an attempt is made to gain unauthorized access to a CGI application running ona web server. Some applications do not perform stringent checks when validating the credentials of a client host connecting to the services offered on a host server. This can lead to unauthorized access and possibly escalated privileges to that of the administrator. Data stored on the machine can be compromised and trust relationships between the victim server and other hosts can be exploited by the attacker.

--
Affected Systems:
All systems running CGI applications using Blog CMS
--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can inject SQL commands to the backend database for an application if user input is not correctly sanitized or checked before passing that input to the database.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploits exist.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Ensure the system is using an up to date version of the software and has had all vendor supplied patches applied.
