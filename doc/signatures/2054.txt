Summary:
Versions of the software tracking system Bugzilla prior to 2.14.1 are 
prone to a vulnerability that allows some degree of account hijacking.

--
Impact:
False data may be represented in the bug tracking database.

--
Detailed Information:
Versions of Bugzilla prior to 2.14.1 and cvs version 2.15 prior to 
20020103 allow non-authorized users to post comments as any user of 
their choosing, including non-valid usernames.

A check to verify the user is valid when posting comments is not 
performed correctly. Using this an attacker might post comments as 
another user in the bugzilla database.

--
Affected Systems:
Bugzilla versions prior to 2.14.1 and cvs versions prior to 2.15 (cvs20020103)

--
Attack Scenarios:
The attacker can manually edit the page to pass his own version of 
variables to the script handling the comments. This script in turn 
passes the data directly to another script that handles the posting of 
bugs without checking the user database.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple

--
False Positives:
None Known

--
False Negatives:
None Known

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade Bugzilla to the latest non-affected version.
